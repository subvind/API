### deploy to railwap.app
To deploy a NestJS app to Railway.app, you can follow these steps:

Prepare Your NestJS App:
Ensure your NestJS app is fully functional and runs without any issues locally. Make sure you have a package.json file with all the required dependencies and scripts for starting the application.

Install Railway CLI:
Install the Railway CLI on your local machine. The CLI allows you to interact with your Railway.app account and deploy applications.

```bash
npm install -g railway
```
Log in to Railway.app:
Log in to your Railway.app account using the CLI. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for free on the Railway.app website.

```bash
railway login
```
Initialize Railway Project:
Navigate to your NestJS app's root directory and initialize your project with Railway. This creates the necessary files and configurations for deployment.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/nestjs/app
railway init
```
Set Environment Variables:
Configure the environment variables required by your NestJS app. You can set environment variables in the railway.env file or use the Railway CLI to set them.

```bash
railway secrets:set KEY=VALUE
```
Replace KEY with the name of the environment variable and VALUE with the corresponding value.

Deploy to Railway.app:
Use the Railway CLI to deploy your NestJS app to Railway.app. The CLI will handle the deployment process for you.
```bash
railway up
```
Access Your Deployed App:
After the deployment is successful, Railway.app will provide you with a unique URL where your NestJS app is hosted. You can use this URL to access your deployed application.
